Enroscar <sub>("twist", "screw in", "screw on" from Spanish)</sub> is an Android library focused on web service clients. 

**We've moved to GitHub.** https://github.com/stanfy/enroscar

**Enroscar goals**

Give solutions to common problems that Android applications face with (mainly focusing on web services clients). And do it via exposing clean and extensible interfaces.
  * a convenient way for performing remote server API communication
  * utilize Android loaders API to load remote data
  * display remote images
  * misc handy widgets
  * and other..

Project aims to be on cutting edge of Android technology: we use android-support package in order to squeeze maximum power of new Android features, moreover we honor old API and provide custom implementation of some new components: DownloadService, AudioFocusHelper, SDKDependentUtils and even more ;)
