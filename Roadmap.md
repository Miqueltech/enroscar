# Features #

  * Parallel API requests
  * Implement API requests cancelation
  * Integration with Android loaders API
  * Enhance music playback support
  * Make usage of quick actions widget simpler
  * Enhance our ImagesManager, not only support loading over HTTP but also appropriately treat local file system and content URIs.

  * ~~Do something with ActionBarSupport (yes, we have such a class but its concept is still not clear). We should provide either an easy integration with other libraries (like [ActionBarSherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com/) or [GreenDroid](http://greendroid.cyrilmottier.com/)) or introduce another idea (or even both)~~

# Documentation, samples, and tests #

  * Provide more samples
  * Unit tests to cover all the staff connected with server API requests
  * Expand documentation
